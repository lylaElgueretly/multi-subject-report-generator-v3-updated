# Attitude & learning behaviours (skills-focused)
# -----------------------
attitude_bank = {
    90: "demonstrated exceptional scientific curiosity and a highly independent approach to learning. She consistently took initiative, reflected critically on her work, and showed maturity in responding to feedback.",
    85: "showed outstanding commitment to developing her Chemistry skills. She asked perceptive questions, engaged actively in lessons, and demonstrated a strong willingness to refine her understanding.",
    80: "approached Chemistry with enthusiasm and a positive attitude. She contributed confidently to discussions and showed clear effort to improve both written and practical work.",
    75: "maintained consistent effort throughout the term. She engaged reliably in learning activities and demonstrated a responsible attitude towards developing her skills.",
    70: "was generally focused in lessons and responded appropriately to guidance. She demonstrated a cooperative attitude and steady engagement with learning tasks.",
    65: "showed developing engagement, though she sometimes required encouragement to persist with more demanding tasks. With support, she demonstrated a positive learning attitude.",
    60: "required regular support to maintain focus, particularly when tasks involved extended reasoning or multi-step processes. She showed improvement when learning was clearly structured.",
    55: "needed frequent reminders to remain engaged and relied heavily on teacher guidance. She benefited most from short, clearly defined tasks.",
    40: "found it challenging to sustain engagement independently and required significant encouragement and scaffolding to participate effectively.",
    0:  "required intensive, individualized support to engage with learning activities and develop basic study habits in Chemistry."

# Chemistry skills & application (IGCSE AO-aligned)
# -----------------------
chemistry_bank = {
    90: "demonstrated exceptional proficiency in applying chemical knowledge to unfamiliar contexts. She analysed data with precision, constructed well-reasoned explanations, and independently designed and evaluated investigations using accurate scientific language.",
    85: "showed strong ability to apply chemical principles logically and accurately. She analysed experimental results effectively, solved complex problems confidently, and communicated explanations with clarity and precision.",
    80: "demonstrated secure skills in interpreting data, applying chemical concepts, and using appropriate scientific terminology. She completed practical tasks competently and showed growing confidence in extended written responses.",
    75: "showed sound understanding and was able to apply knowledge to standard problems. She followed practical procedures accurately and recorded observations clearly, drawing reasonable conclusions from data.",
    70: "demonstrated the ability to follow methods and apply familiar concepts appropriately. With guidance, she interpreted results and explained outcomes using basic scientific reasoning.",
    65: "showed developing skills in applying chemical knowledge. She required support with multi-step calculations, data interpretation, and extended explanations but demonstrated progress over time.",
    60: "demonstrated basic chemical understanding but needed structured support to apply this knowledge to problem-solving tasks. Practical work was completed with close guidance.",
    55: "showed limited ability to apply chemical ideas independently. She required step-by-step support to complete calculations, interpret data, and carry out practical procedures safely.",
    40: "struggled to apply chemical knowledge and required substantial scaffolding to interpret information, complete investigations, and explain results.",
    0:  "found it extremely difficult to access core Chemistry skills, requiring intensive support to complete even highly scaffolded tasks and practical activities."

# Next steps / skill-based targets
# -----------------------
target_bank = {
    90: "To extend her skills further, she should challenge herself with unfamiliar problem-solving questions and independently evaluate the reliability of experimental data, including sources of error and limitations.",
    85: "To progress further, she should continue refining her precision in calculations and focus on producing consistently detailed, well-structured extended responses under exam conditions.",
    80: "Next term, she should focus on strengthening examination technique, particularly applying knowledge to unfamiliar contexts and improving the clarity of extended written explanations.",
    75: "For continued progress, she should practise multi-step calculations and develop more detailed analytical explanations when interpreting experimental results.",
    70: "To build confidence, she should work on linking observations to scientific explanations and improving accuracy when interpreting graphs and tables.",
    65: "Next term, she should focus on developing fluency in calculations and practising structured explanations using correct scientific terminology.",
    60: "To improve further, she should strengthen foundational skills in data interpretation, calculations, and laboratory procedures through regular guided practice.",
    55: "She should focus on building confidence in basic calculations, following practical methods accurately, and using key scientific vocabulary correctly.",
    40: "To build foundational skills, she should practise interpreting simple data, following clear experimental steps, and reinforcing core scientific language.",
    0:  "Initial focus should be on developing basic laboratory safety awareness, recognising common equipment, and engaging with simple, supported investigative tasks."
