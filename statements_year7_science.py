    75: "worked consistently and followed instructions carefully during investigations",
    70: "engaged well in lessons and responded appropriately to guidance",
    65: "showed steady effort but occasionally relied on prompts to remain focused",
    60: "required some support to stay engaged and complete tasks effectively",
    55: "needed regular guidance to remain focused and organised",
    40: "found it difficult to sustain focus and needed frequent reminders",

# ---------- Closing Remarks ----------
closer_bank = [
    "Overall, the student made steady progress in applying scientific knowledge during investigations",
    "With continued practice, the student is developing confidence in practical and theoretical science",
    "Progress was evident as the student began to link scientific ideas with evidence"
