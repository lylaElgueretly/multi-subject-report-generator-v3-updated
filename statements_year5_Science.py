# ---------- Attitude & Learning Behaviours ----------
# Focus: curiosity, willingness to explore, engagement with hands-on learning
attitude_bank = {
    90: "showed strong curiosity, regularly asking thoughtful questions and exploring ideas with enthusiasm",
    85: "approached learning with interest and confidence, engaging actively in discussions and tasks",
    80: "showed enthusiasm for science and took part positively in investigations",
    75: "worked well in lessons and contributed sensibly during practical activities",
    70: "engaged with learning and followed instructions carefully during tasks",
    65: "showed a generally positive attitude but sometimes needed encouragement to stay focused",
    60: "needed support to remain engaged and complete tasks independently",
    55: "required regular reminders to stay focused and involved in activities",
    40: "found it challenging to stay engaged and needed frequent encouragement",
    0:  "required significant support to participate confidently in science lessons"
}


# ---------- Science Skills & Understanding (ACHIEVEMENT) ----------
# Focus: observation, simple testing, recording, basic explanations
science_bank = {
    90: "made careful observations, identified clear patterns, and explained results using scientific vocabulary",
    85: "observed changes accurately and used evidence to explain what happened",
    80: "made sensible observations and explained outcomes using simple scientific language",
    75: "recorded results clearly and described what happened during investigations",
    70: "made basic observations and described results with some support",
    65: "identified simple changes or patterns when guided",
    60: "showed basic understanding of ideas explored in class investigations",
    55: "recorded simple results but needed support to explain them",
    40: "found it difficult to describe observations without support",
    0:  "needed significant guidance to observe, record, and explain scientific ideas"

# ---------- Next Steps / Targets ----------
# Focus: moving from observation → explanation → simple reasoning
target_bank = {
    90: "begin to plan simple tests independently and explain results using clear scientific reasoning",
    85: "develop explanations further by linking observations to scientific ideas",
    80: "use results to explain why changes occurred during investigations",
    75: "focus on explaining results clearly using evidence from observations",
    70: "practise recording results carefully and describing patterns noticed",
    65: "work on making clear observations and explaining what happened",
    60: "develop confidence in recording results and discussing findings",
    55: "practise describing observations using simple scientific vocabulary",
    40: "focus on making observations and recording results with guidance",
    0:  "begin with supported activities to build confidence in observing and recording results"
}


# ---------- Closing Remarks ----------
closer_bank = [
    "Overall, the student showed growing curiosity and confidence when exploring scientific ideas",
    "With continued practice, the student is developing secure skills in observation and investigation",
    "Progress was evident as the student became more confident in practical science work"
